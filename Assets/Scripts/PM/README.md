### Goal

* Reconstruct the manual by dissecting and analyzing the code in this folder.
* You don't need to use a modkit repository, but you can do it anyway for error-checking.
* You are free to use whatever tools you want.
* Also it's missing a dependancy: https://github.com/Emik03/KeepCoding/releases/tag/1.3-beta
* Have fun and good luck! :)
